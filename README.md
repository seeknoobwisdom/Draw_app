## 🧩 About

The **Grapnote** project aims to make digital writing feel as natural as pen and paper.  
It accepts input from **anything the screen detects** — a cheap stylus, charger tip, or even your finger — and filters every other touch automatically.

The result: you can rest your hand freely, focus on your ideas, and enjoy **smooth, realistic handwriting** without expensive accessories.
