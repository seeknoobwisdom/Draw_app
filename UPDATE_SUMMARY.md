# 🎉 Update Summary - Grapnote Enhanced!

## ✨ New Features Added

### 1. 🖐️ Palm-First Mode (Major Feature!)

**What it does:**
- Ignores the FIRST touch (assumes it's your palm)
- Uses the SECOND touch as your drawing tool
- Perfect for users who naturally rest their palm before writing

**Why it's awesome:**
- Most realistic paper-like experience
- Natural writing posture
- Prevents accidental marks even better
- Comfortable for long writing sessions

**How to use:**
1. Tap ⚙️ Settings button
2. Select "Palm-First Mode"
3. Rest your palm on screen FIRST
4. Then touch with stylus/finger to draw
5. Keep palm down while writing!

**Important:** Single touch won't draw in this mode - you need both palm AND stylus on screen!

### 2. ⚙️ Settings Dialog

**Beautiful new settings interface:**
- Modern gradient design
- Two selectable modes with visual cards
- Real-time mode switching
- Helpful tips for each mode
- Animated selection feedback

**Features:**
- Icon-based mode selection
- Clear descriptions

- Tips displayed based on selected mode

### 3. 🧹 Fixed Eraser (Critical Fix!)

**What was wrong:**
- Eraser was drawing WHITE lines
- Didn't actually erase previous strokes
- Just covered them with white paint

**What's fixed:**
- Eraser now PROPERLY erases strokes
- Uses `BlendMode.clear` for true transparency
- Implemented `saveLayer` for proper compositing
- Works on any background color
- Erases ALL types of strokes (pen, highlighter, previous eraser)

**Technical improvement:**
```dart
// Before: Just white paint
paint.color = Colors.white;

// After: True erasing
paint.blendMode = BlendMode.clear;
canvas.saveLayer(...);
```

## 🛠️ Technical Improvements

### DrawingController Updates
```dart
// New properties
int? _ignoredPointerId;      // Tracks ignored touch (palm)
bool _palmFirstMode = false;  // Mode toggle

// New method
void setPalmFirstMode(bool enabled) {
  // Switches between modes safely
  // Resets all pointer tracking
}
```
